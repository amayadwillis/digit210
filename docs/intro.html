        <p>My project group decided to analyze Disney songs. We started with the songs from the four Aladdin movies (Aladdin, Aladdin: The Return of Jafar, Aladdin and the King of Thieves, and Aladdin Live-Action). We split the songs up among the three of us and we all coded the songs assigned to us and used a schema that we created together.</p>
